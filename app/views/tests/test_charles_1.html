            <div style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 0px;">Classes are held daily between Sunday and Friday. Most groups meet three times per week. At the time of your enrollment, after your English level has been determined, we will place you in a group according to your ability and time preferences. On weekdays, lessons are held from 16.00 to 18.00 and from 19.00 to 21.00. Conversation sessions are held from 18.00 to 19.00. On Sundays, classes are held in two-hour blocks between 11.00 and 18.00, and the conversation session is held from 13.00 to 14.00. This schedule may change, depending on our level of enrollment.</div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px;">The American Linguistics Center&nbsp;offers language instruction at all levels of instruction from beginner to advanced. We have three&nbsp;levels of conversation English instruction, five levels of business English training, five levels of Continued Studies, and preparation for the TOEFL exam. The levels are divided as follows:</div>
            <div style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Level 0a, 0b - Basic</div>
            <div style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#0000FF">Level 1a, 1b -&nbsp;Elementary</font></div>

            <div style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#CC00CC">Level B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 - Business English</font></div>
            <div style="margin-left: 140px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#3399FF">Level C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 - Conversation English</font></div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 0px;">Here is a graphical representation of the levels of progression, showing the materials used in each level of instruction. In some levels, final competency exams must be passed in order to progress to the next level.</div>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Each level lasts for seven weeks. Depending on enrollment, not all levels are offered every semester. Please call us during registration to find out which classes will be offered in the upcoming semester.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="How many students are in your groups">How many students are in your groups?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">The number of students can vary, but we usually have an average of 6. If we have more than 10 students in a class, we will split the class in two, if another teacher is available at that time. If fewer than four students are enrolled in a class, we may either cancel it or merge those students into other classes.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The number of students who attend conversation sessions is not fixed and can vary widely.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="I&rsquo;ve never studied English before. Can your school teach me">I&rsquo;ve never studied English before. Can your center teach me?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The American Linguistics Center offers Level 0 for people who have never studied English. This level, taught primarily in Russian, introduce students to the English alphabet, the pronunciation of English sounds, and familiarizes students with the fundamental elements of English speech, such as the proper conjugations of verbs. Students who successfully complete Level 0 should be ready for study in our Level 1a.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="I&rsquo;ve already finished / graduated from another English school">I&rsquo;ve already finished / graduated from another English school. Can I choose my level of study at your center?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Unfortunately, not. This is because curriculums and teaching methods between schools vary widely. At the time of enrollment, all students receive a written and oral test in order to determine English speaking and comprehension ability. We do this in order to place you in the proper group. Our level of standards are very high, so although you may have graduated from another center, we may place you at lower a level than you expect if we detect any deficiencies.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="How much Russian is used in the classroom">How much Russian is used in the classroom?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">In general, we discourage the use of any language besides English during our lessons. However, we realize that people don&rsquo;t come to our center with a fluent knowledge of English, or they wouldn&rsquo;t come to us in the first place. So some Russian is permitted, as follows.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">In the absolute beginners&rsquo; level, Level 0, in order to facilitate a clear and proper understanding of basic grammar, the material is presented primarily in Russian, and the English lesson material has Russian translations.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">In the lower levels, 1a and 1b, English grammar explanations are described in both Russian and English. All lesson material is only in English.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">In the middle and upper levels, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, and in all business and conversation level sections, all material is written in English. Russian is not used at all and is not permitted to be spoken between students while the class is in session.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">It may be helpful to know that some of our native speakers of English don&rsquo;t know Russian, so you would have to interact with them only in English anyway.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Do you teach children">Do you teach children?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">As a rule, we do not accept children younger than age 12. Although children would benefit from our teaching methodologies, the material used in our lessons touches upon adult themes and would not be interesting for them. Simply stated, our program is designed for adult learners.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Do you offer corporate training">Do you offer corporate training?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Yes. We offer conversational and business English training for your employees at their office location. Such sessions are generally held in the mornings and afternoons. Please see our<a style="" href="http://new.alc.com.ua/corporate_training.html">Corporate Training</a>&nbsp;page for more information. Call us if you have specific needs.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Does your staff give private lessons">Does your staff give private lessons?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The American Linguistics Center can arrange private lessons for you with one our native speakers or qualified Ukrainian speakers of English. Lessons are conducted in a comfortable private room at the Center. Available meeting times depend on instructor's work schedule, but they are usually flexible. See our&nbsp;<a style="" href="http://new.alc.com.ua/private_lessons.html">Private Lessons</a>&nbsp;page for more information. If you wish to have private lessons outside the Center, please see our&nbsp;<a style="" href="http://new.alc.com.ua/corporate_training.html">Corporate Training</a>&nbsp;page.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">This is a difficult question, as the answer depends a lot on the student. Anyone can become fluent in English if enough time is given, but a person&rsquo;s natural affinity for acquiring languages will greatly speed the process. Our experience has told us that a strong, active desire to learn is more important than natural ability. Students who consistently work hard and take an active role in their learning have better results than those who do not. Beginners who start our program should be able converse in English by successful completion of Level 2a.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="I think I speak English rather well, but I have a strong accent. Can you help me with this">I think I speak English rather well, but I have a strong accent. Can you help me with this?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">We employ native speakers, one of whose jobs is to correct your pronunciation. Whether you are a beginning, intermediate, or advanced speaker, we will teach you proper pronunciation and elocution according to the rules of Standard American English. Most of the original audio material provided with our program was recorded by native speakers. Imitating their pronunciation of the lesson material will aid you in minimizing or eliminating your accent.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The material for our mainstream English program was developed over the course of a year and is derivative of well-respected, published texts. Our methodology does not require the memorization of complex grammatical rules or the translation of texts; rather, we get students to think in English through the memorization of common language patterns. This is similar to the way children learn their native language.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">Each mainstream English lesson comes with about an hour's worth of homework. We encourage the student to complete all homework BEFORE the pertinent lesson is conducted in class. This way, the oral lesson serves to reinforce the knowledge that was previously learned individually.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">There are two parts to the homework for each lesson: audio and fill-in-the-blank. First, the audio material, which is in MP3 format, must be listened to from start to finish at least once. The average listening time for each lesson is about 15 minutes. Next, the fill-in-the-blank homework section should be completed. This should require an additional 45 minutes.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">After the homework is completed by the student, it is handed in to the tutor for grading. All homework grades are recorded in the student&rsquo;s file for review by the instructor.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Will I have to take tests">Will I have to take tests?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">Yes. Every mainstream English lesson has a written mini-test that must be completed within a week after the lesson is done in class. All mini tests consist of 20 questions and cover key grammatical topics and vocabulary presented in the lessons. This test is graded and may be viewed by the student.<span lang="ru">&nbsp;All mini-test scores are recorded for later review by the instructor.</span></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">At the end of the semester, all students in Levels 2a and higher must take a two-part final exam covering vocabulary and grammar. The vocabulary portion tests the students' knowledge of new vocabulary words presented during the semester. The grammar portion covers all the new grammar presented during the semester. Only students who pass both exams are permitted to continue to the next higher level of study at our center.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">In addition to the mini-tests and final exam, instructors may give grammar and vocabulary quizzes during the lessons.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Tell me about the beginners level.">Tell me about the beginners' level.</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The beginner's level, Level 0, was created&nbsp;to accommodate beginning students who have never studied English or who studied a language other than English. This level covers the fundamentals of the English language, such as the sounds of alphabet, correct formation of letters, and basic morphology. Additionally, this level serves to increase vocabulary and fluency. There is some overlap of grammar topics between Levels 0 and 1a.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="What are the Conversation English levels (C1, C2, C3, etc.)">What are the Conversation English levels (C1, C2, C3, etc.)?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The lessons in these levels are taught from the&nbsp;<a style=" color: blue;" target="new" href="http://www.pearsonlongman.com/languageleader">Language Leader</a>&nbsp;series by Pearson Longman and the&nbsp;<a style=" color: blue;" target="new" href="http://www.expresspublishing.co.uk/catalogue_details/details.php?Country=uk&amp;id=2066">Upstream</a>&nbsp;series by Express Publishing. They are different from our mainstream lessons in that they are conversation-based instead of drill-based, and the lessons are loosely structured and less intensive. The groups meet for two hours, three times per week. One lesson per week is devoted exclusively to grammar. About four hours of homework is required each week, which includes listening and written portions. The Conversation English lessons are ideal for students who want mainly to expand their vocabulary or maintain their current speaking level of English. Students may enroll in these lessons after successful completion of Level 2a or by receiving a satisfactory score on our diagnostic test.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><a style="" name="Why did you choose the Language Leader and Upstream textbooks">Why did you choose the Language Leader and Upstream textbooks?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">We reviewed dozens of English textbooks currently on the market. We were looking for textbooks that were interesting for students (and teachers) and had a wide variety of engaging real-world topics. Both the&nbsp;<a style=" color: blue;" target="new" href="http://www.pearsonlongman.com/languageleader">Language Leader</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a style=" color: blue;" target="new" href="http://www.expresspublishing.co.uk/catalogue_details/details.php?Country=uk&amp;id=2066">Upstream</a>&nbsp;have all of these features and more. We believe that these books have some of the best balances of grammar instruction and conversation practice of all books currently available.&nbsp;And the lessons are fun. If you have never studied using these books, we think you will be impressed with them.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Do I have to buy the Language Leader and Upstream textbooks Can I bring my own if I already have one">Do I have to buy the Language Leader and Upstream textbooks? Can I bring my own if I already have one?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">It is not necessary that you purchase your own copy of these books as we distribute center-owned copies for use during the lessons. However, we do sell copies of these books for students who want a personal copy do self-study or review lessons before or after class. We receive these books at a discount from our distributor and pass along the discount. For this reason, it is cheaper for you to buy your book through us than from a local bookstore. If you already own a copy of the appropriate textbook or wish to purchase one elsewhere, you are welcome to use it in class.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><a style="" name="May I attend only the Conversation Sessions without taking lessons">May I attend only the Conversation Sessions without taking lessons?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">We offer Conversation Sessions to people who wish only to maintain their level of English and don't want (or are unable) to attend lessons. The cost to attend only Conversation Sessions without lessons is 650 hrv. per semester (seven weeks). Students may attend up to four sessions per week and check out audio books and DVDs from the Center's Audio and Video Libraries.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b>Business English &amp; TOEFL</b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Tell me about your business English course.">Tell me about your Business English program.</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">The American&nbsp;Linguistics Center offers a five-level Business English program based on the excellent new&nbsp;<a style="" target="new" href="http://www.market-leader.net/">Market Leader</a>&nbsp;series published by Pearson-Longman. The groups meet for two hours, three times per week. One lesson per week is focused exclusively on grammar. The training features intensive speaking, listening, reading, discussion, writing, and vocabulary building, all in the context of business communication. The homework&nbsp;consists of writing and listening sections.<font face="Trebuchet MS">&nbsp;Current students who have successfully completed our Level 3a or 3b and new students who demonstrate a sufficiently high level of English are eligible to enroll.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="How much material is covered each semester in the business English program">How much material is covered each semester?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;">The amount of material covered is not fixed; it depends mainly on the learning rate of the class. Most of the books consist of fourteen units, plus two Revision units. A typical class progresses at the rate of about one unit every two lessons. Generally, we strive to complete one book per seven-week semester.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Additionally, every lesson is accompanied by homework designed to reinforce and supplement the student&rsquo;s knowledge of the lessons' topics.<span lang="ru">&nbsp;On the average, students can expect to spend about at least three hours per week on homework.<span lang="ru">&nbsp;This homework is to be completed and turned-in to our staff for correction.</span></span></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><a style="" name="Why did you choose the Market Leader series">Why did you choose the Market Leader series?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">We believe that the Market Leader books are unmatched in their authentic representations of actual business situations and therefore provide an excellent foundation for the learning of business English. The lessons include practice in speaking, listening and reading. There is also a heavy emphasis on writing business correspondence.&nbsp;If you have never studied using this series, we think you will impressed with it.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><a style="" name="Do I have to buy the New Market Leader textbook">Do I have to buy the Market Leader textbook?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">It is essential that you own a personal copy of the Market Leader Course Book for the lessons. We recommend that you purchase your copy through us, as we receive a discount from our supplier and would pass this discount on to you. If you wish to purchase your book from another source, keep in mind that there are five books in this series and the book we use changes every semester. Check with us before you buy your book to make sure you buy the right one. Of course, if you already own a copy of the appropriate Market Leader book, you are welcome to use it in class. It is not necessary to buy the Practice File book or any other supplemental materials - we will supply them for you.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">As of the September 2008 semester, we offer a seven-week TOEFL test preparation program based on the&nbsp;<u><a style="" target="new" href="http://www.pearsonlongman.com/ae/marketing/toeflibt/index.html">Longman Preparation Course for the TOEFL Test</a></u>&nbsp;by Deborah Phillips.&nbsp;The program covers all aspects of the computer-based test, including reading, writing, listening, and speech.&nbsp;This program is taught only if a sufficient number of students enroll in it. (Five is the minimum.) For this reason, we may not offer the program every semester. The cost of the program is 1500 hrv.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;"><a style="" name="How important is grammar knowledge in getting a good score on the TOEFL">How important is grammar knowledge in getting a good score on the TOEFL?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px;">The TOEFL exam has been re-structured in recent years to emphasize real world communication ability over book learning. Strict knowledge of grammar rules for its own sake is no longer required; however, you are expected to speak and write without excessive errors in order to receive good scores in these areas.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;"><a style="" name="Can this course help me to improve my scores if I have trouble speaking or understanding English">Can this course help me to improve my scores if I have trouble speaking or understanding English?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px;">It&nbsp;depends on how serious your deficiencies are. The main purpose of our course is to apply previously acquired language skills to test-taking strategies. Those students who have problems with speaking or listening comprehension should take a more general language course before attempting this one in order to receive the maximum benefit.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;"><a style="" name="When should I begin preparation for the TOEFL">When should I begin preparation for the TOEFL?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px;">We recommend that you begin preparation no later than three months before you are scheduled to take your TOEFL exam.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;"><a style="" name="Is seven weeks really enough time to prepare for the TOEFL">Is seven weeks really enough time to prepare for the TOEFL?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px;">Yes.&nbsp;If you are reasonably diligent and your English skills are already sufficient, you will not need more than seven weeks to prepare, maybe even less.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;"><a style="" name="Should I take the TOEFL Preparation Course to improve my English">Should I take the TOEFL Preparation Course to improve my English?</a></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px;">We do not recommend that you take the TOEFL preparation course purely for the improvement of English (if you don't plan to take the exam). Although the practice may help, you might find most of the material tedious or irrelevant, as it deals primarily with test-taking strategies. If you wish to improve your English, our other programs are much more useful and interesting.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="#0066FF">Other Questions</font></b></p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Generally, diplomas in Ukraine are offered only by state-run and state-sanctioned educational institutions. Such a document ostensibly grants you authorization to translate and teach in English in Ukraine. Although we are legally permitted to teach English, we are not specifically authorized to issue diplomas or certificates of completion. As a side note, please be wary of any English center or center that offers to give you a diploma when you graduate.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="When and how do I pay for the lessons">When and how do I pay for the lessons?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">You pay for the lessons at the time of enrollment. Optionally, you may pay us half of the tuition at the time of your enrollment and the remaining balance before the end of fourth week. We accept cash payments, or you may pay through our bank account.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Do you offer discounts">Do you offer discounts?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">Absolutely. There are a few ways to receive discounts at the American Linguistics Center.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">First, if you are a current student, you automatically receive a five percent discount at the time of reenrollment in the following semester if you receive a passing grade on all homework and tests.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">Second, if you refer a friend or family member to our center, and that person enrolls and attends classes, you receive a five percent discount on the cost of your tuition for that semester. This amount is refunded to you at the third week of the semester. This discount is cumulative.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">Third, if you are currently attending another English school in Dnipropetrovs&rsquo;k or have attended one during the last semester, we will give you a five percent discount on tuition for the first semester for trying our program. To claim your discount, bring us your registration card, payment receipt, or any other official documentation from the other center that shows your time of enrollment.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Unfortunately, we cannot offer discounts on textbooks, as we already sell them for the price we pay for them.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="I cannot (or don&rsquo;t wish to) finish the semester. Can I get a refund">I cannot (or don&rsquo;t wish to) finish the semester. Can I get a refund?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">We will give you a prorated refund if you withdrawal from the center for any reason up to the end of the third week. If you withdraw from the center between the beginning of the third and the end of the fifth week, we will give you prorated credit for study with us in the next semester. We do not offer refunds or credits for books or withdrawals after the fourth week.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Do I get a refund if I can&rsquo;t speak English after I finish your center">Do I get a refund if I can&rsquo;t speak English after I finish your center?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">This situation cannot happen. If you attend our center and do all we require of you, you will learn to speak English. In fact, you will likely speak very well. Conversely, if you somehow don&rsquo;t learn to speak English, you will not be able to finish our center.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;"><b><a style="" name="Can I still attend conversation sessions to maintain my level of English after I finish the center">Can I still attend conversation sessions to maintain my level of English after I finish the center?</a></b></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">Yes. After you complete Level B5, C5, or 3b, for 550 hrv., you may attend as many conversation sessions as you&rsquo;d like for one semester. You would also have access to our vast video library and other Center resources.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 5px;">There is no connection, except that the founding members of the American Linguistics Center are former teachers at the American English Center in Dnipropetrovs&rsquo;k.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">We are continually expanding and looking for bright, experienced, motivated staff. Our ideal teaching candidate should either be a native speaker or speak English with no (or very little) accent and should have a university degree in English or American Studies. For native speakers, a CELTA-endorsed TEFL certification is acceptable in lieu of an academic degree in English teaching. Teaching experience is preferable but not essential &ndash; we will train you.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">At this time, we are looking to expand to other cities. If you currently live in Dneprodzerzhinsk,<span class="SpellE">&nbsp;Zaporozhye, Kharkov, or are willing to relocate to one of these cities, we would be especially willing to hear from you.</span></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 5px;">If you are interested in working for us, please email us your CV in .pdf format along with a brief cover letter (in English). Introduce yourself and tell us why you would like to join our staff. We will respond to all inquiries either by email or telephone as time permits.</p>
